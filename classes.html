                        <p>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice of yoga, 
                        this 60-minute class of poses and slow movement focuses on asana (proper alignment and posture), 
                        pranayama (breath work), and guided meditation to foster your mind and body connection.</p>

                        60-minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized movement â€” you will inhale and exhale as 
                        you flow energetically through yoga poses.</p>

                    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
                    <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up. 
                    Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. 
                    When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position 
                    with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
